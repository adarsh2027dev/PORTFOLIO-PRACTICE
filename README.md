# 💼 Practice Portfolio (Vanilla Project)

> A creative front-end **practice project** built using pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
> This isn’t my official portfolio — it’s the one where I explored **CSS transitions**, **animations**, and **responsive design** from scratch. 🚀  

---

## 🎨 Highlights
- ⚡ Smooth **CSS transitions** and hover animations  
- 🧩 **Flexbox** and **Grid layouts** for structure and alignment  
- 🖱️ Interactive **navbars, buttons, and hover effects**  
- 🌈 Clean UI with subtle **color gradients** and shadows  
- 📱 **Fully responsive** across devices  

---

## 💡 What I Learned
- The real power of **CSS animations** and timing functions  
- How **positioning, layering, and transforms** work together  
- Building layouts with **Flexbox and Grid** confidently  
- Crafting a responsive design using **media queries**  
> ✨ Every transition I created boosted my confidence in front-end development!
